# Question 15: Two stack in an Array:

## Your task is to implement  2 stacks in one array efficiently. You need to implement 4 methods.

twoStacks : Initialize the data structures and variables to be used to implement  2 stacks in one array.

push1 : pushes element into the first stack.

push2 : pushes element into the second stack.

pop1 : pops an element from the first stack and returns the popped element. If the first stack is empty, it should return -1.

pop2 : pops an element from the second stack and returns the popped element. If the second stack is empty, it should return -1.

### Examples:
Input:

push1(2)

push1(3)

push2(4)

pop1()

pop2()

pop2()

Output: [3, 4, -1]

Explanation:

push1(2) the stack1 will be {2}

push1(3) the stack1 will be {2,3}

push2(4) the stack2 will be {4}

pop1()   the poped element will be 3 from stack1 and stack1 will be {2}

pop2()   the poped element will be 4 from stack2 and now stack2 is empty

pop2()   the stack2 is now empty hence returned -1.

## âœ…Python code:

```
class TwoStacks:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack1=[]
        self.stack2=[]

    # Function to push an integer into stack 1
    def push1(self, x):
        self.stack1.append(x)
        

    # Function to push an integer into stack 2
    def push2(self, x):
        self.stack2.append(x)

    # Function to remove an element from top of stack 1
    def pop1(self):
        if self.stack1:
            return self.stack1.pop()
        else:
            return -1

    # Function to remove an element from top of stack 2
    def pop2(self):
        if self.stack2:
            return self.stack2.pop()
        else:
            return -1
```
