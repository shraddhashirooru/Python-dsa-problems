# Question 16: Next greater element using circular array:

## Given a circular integer array nums (i.e., the next element of nums[nums.length - 1] is nums[0]), return the next greater number for every element in nums.
The next greater number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, return -1 for this number.

### Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,1]

Output: [2,-1,2]

Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 

The number 2 can't find next greater number. 

The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.

## âœ…Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def nextGreaterElements(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        stack=[]
        n=len(nums)
        a=[0]*n
        for i in range(2*n-1,-1,-1):
            ind=i%n             
            while stack and stack[-1]<=nums[ind]:
                stack.pop()
            if i<=n-1:
                if not stack:
                    a[i]=-1
                else:
                    a[i]=stack[-1]
            stack.append(nums[ind])
        return a
```
