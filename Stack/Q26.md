# Question 26: Celebrity problem:

## A celebrity is a person who is known to all but does not know anyone at a party. A party is being organized by some people. A square matrix mat[][] (n*n) is used to represent people at the party such that if an element of row i and column j is set to 1 it means ith person knows jth person. You need to return the index of the celebrity in the party, if the celebrity does not exist, return -1.
Note: Follow 0-based indexing.

---
### Examples:

Input: mat[][] = [[1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1]]

Output: 1

Explanation: 0th and 2nd person both know 1st person. Therefore, 1 is the celebrity person. 

Input: mat[][] = [[1, 1], [1, 1]]

Output: -1

Explanation: Since both the people at the party know each other. Hence none of them is a celebrity person.

## ✅Python code 1:

```
class Solution:
    def celebrity(self, mat):
        n=len(mat)
        i=0
        j=n-1
        
        while i<j:
            if mat[i][j]==1:
                i=i+1
            elif mat[j][i]==1:
                j=j-1
            else:
                while i<j and mat[j][i]==0:
                    i=i+1
                while i<j and mat[i][j]==0:
                    j=j-1
        if i==j:
            for k in range(n):
                if i!=k and mat[i][k]==1:
                    return -1
            for l in range(n):
                if i!=l and mat[l][i]==0:
                    return -1
            return i
        else:
            return -1
