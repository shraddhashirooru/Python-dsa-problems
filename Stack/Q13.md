# Question 13: Get minimum at pop:

## You are given an integer array A[]. You need to first push the elements of the array into a stack and then print minimum in the stack at each pop until stack becomes empty.

---
### Examples:

Input: A[] = [1 2 3 4 5]

Output: 1 1 1 1 1

Explanation: 

After pushing elements to the stack, the stack will be "top -> 5, 4, 3, 2, 1". Now, start popping elements from the stack

popping 5: min in the stack is 1.popped 5

popping 4: min in the stack is 1. popped 4

popping 3: min in the stack is 1. popped 3

popping 2: min in the stack is 1. popped 2

popping 1: min in the stack is 1. popped 1

---
## âœ… Python code:

```
def _push(a,n):
    stack=[]
    stack.append(a[0])
    for i in range(1,n):
        if a[i]>stack[-1]:
            stack.append(stack[-1])
        else:
            stack.append(a[i])
    return stack      

#Function to print minimum value in stack each time while popping.    
def _getMinAtPop(stack):
    while stack:
        print(stack.pop(),end=" ")
```
