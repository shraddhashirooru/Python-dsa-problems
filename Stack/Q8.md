# Question 8: Delete k number of elements if arr[i]<arr[i+1] :

## Given an array arr[] and a number k. The task is to delete k elements that are smaller than the next element (i.e., we delete arr[i] if arr[i] < arr[i+1]) or become smaller than the next because the next element is deleted.

---
### Examples:

Input: arr[] = [20, 10, 25, 30, 40], k = 2

Output: [25, 30, 40]

Explanation: First we delete 10 because it follows arr[i] < arr[i+1]. Then we delete 20 because 25 is moved next to it and it also starts following the condition.

## âœ… Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def deleteElement(self,arr,k):
        stack=[]
        n=len(arr)
        count=0
        for i in range(n):
            if not stack:
                stack.append(arr[i])
            elif count<k and stack[-1]<arr[i]:
                while count<k and stack and stack[-1]<arr[i]:
                    stack.pop()
                    count=count+1
                stack.append(arr[i])
            else:
                stack.append(arr[i])
        return stack
```
