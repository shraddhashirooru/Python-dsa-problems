# Question 19: Number of greater elements to the right for specific elements:

## Given an array of N integers and Q queries of indices. For each query indices[i], determine the count of elements in arr that are strictly greater than arr[indices[i]] to its right (after the position indices[i]).

### Examples :

Input: arr[] = [3, 4, 2, 7, 5, 8, 10, 6], queries = 2, indices[] = [0, 5]

Output:  [6, 1]

Explanation: The next greater elements to the right of 3(index 0) are 4,7,5,8,10,6. The next greater elements to the right of 8(index 5) is only 10.

        while i<N:

                if indices[j]<i and arr[indices[j]]<arr[i]:
                    a[j]=a[j]+1
            i=i+1
