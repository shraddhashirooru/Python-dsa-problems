# Question 2: Operations on Stack :

## Given a stack of integers and Q queries. The task is to perform the operation on stack according to the query.

The queries can be of 4 types:

i x: (adds element x in the stack).

r: (removes the topmost element from the stack).

h: Prints the topmost element.

f y: (check if the element y is present or not in the stack). Print "Yes" if present, else "No". 

---
### Examples:
Input: Q = 6, Queries = [[i, 2], [i, 4], [i, 3],[i, 5], [h], [f, 8]]

Output: 

5

No

Explanation: Inserting 2, 4, 3, and 5 onto the stack. Returning top element which is 5. Finding 8 will give No, as 8 is not in the stack.

---
## âœ… Python code:

```
def insert(stack,x):
    stack.append(x)

#Function to remove top element from stack.
def remove(stack):
    stack.pop()
    
#Function to print the top element of stack.    
def headOf_Stack(stack):
    return stack[-1]
    
#Function to search an element in the stack.
def find(stack,x):
    if x in stack:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
