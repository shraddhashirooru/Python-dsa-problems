# Question 4: Remove the consecutive duplicates from the given string using a Stack :

## You are given string s. You need to remove the consecutive duplicates from the given string using a Stack.  

### Examples:

Input: s = "aaaaaabaabccccccc"

Output: ababc

Explanation: The order is in the following way 6->a, 1->b, 2->a, 1->b, 7->c. So, only one element from each group will remain and rest all are removed. Therefore, final string will be:- ababc.

                continue
            else:
                stack.append(i)
        return "".join(stack)
