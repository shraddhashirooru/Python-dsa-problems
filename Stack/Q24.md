# Question 24: Sliding window maximum:

## You are given an array of integers nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position. Return the max sliding window.

### Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3

Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7]

Explanation: 

Window position                Max

---------------               -----

[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3

 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
 
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
 
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
 
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
 
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7

## âœ…Python code:

```
from collections import deque
class Solution:
    def maxSlidingWindow(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        stack=deque()
        n=len(nums)
        a=[]
        for i in range(n):
            while stack and nums[stack[-1]]<=nums[i]:
                stack.pop()
            if i>=k-1:
                if stack and stack[0]<=i-k:
                    stack.popleft()
                if stack and stack[0]>i-k:
                    a.append(nums[stack[0]])
                else:
                    a.append(nums[i])            
            stack.append(i)          
        return a
```
