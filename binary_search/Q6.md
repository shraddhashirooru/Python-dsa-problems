# Question 6: Finding floor of x in a sorted array: (lower bound)

## Given a sorted array arr[] and an integer x, find the index (0-based) of the largest element in arr[] that is less than or equal to x. This element is called the floor of x. If such an element does not exist, return -1.
Note: In case of multiple occurrences of ceil of x, return the index of the last occurrence.

### Examples

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 8, 10, 10, 12, 19], x = 5

Output: 1

Explanation: Largest number less than or equal to 5 is 2, whose index is 1.

        while i<=j:
            mid=(i+j)//2
            if arr[mid]<=x:

                i=mid+1
            else:
                j=mid-1
