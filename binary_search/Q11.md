# Question 6: Finding magical number:

## Your friend loves magic and he has coined a new term - "Magical number". To perform his magic, he needs that magic number. You are given a sorted array arr of distinct integers. A number arr[i] is a magical number if arr[i] = i (0-based indexing).
You have to return the leftmost magical number present in the given array arr, if there is no magical number in the array arr then return -1

### Examples:

Input: arr[] = [-2, -1, 2, 4, 6]

Output: 2

Explanation: There is only one magical number present at index 2 because arr[2] = 2.

## âœ…Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def findMagicalNumber(self, arr):
        n=len(arr)
        i=0
        j=n-1
        ans=-1
        while i<=j:
            mid=(i+j)//2
            if arr[mid]==mid:
                ans=mid
                j=mid-1
            elif arr[mid]>mid:
                j=mid-1
            else:
                i=mid+1
        return ans
```
