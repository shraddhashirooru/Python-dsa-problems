# Question 1: Finding square root of n:

## Given a positive integer n, find the square root of n. If n is not a perfect square, then return the floor value. Floor value of any number is the greatest Integer which is less than or equal to that number

---
### Examples:

Input: n = 4

Output: 2

Explanation: Since, 4 is a perfect square, so its square root is 2.

## âœ… Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def floorSqrt(self, n): 
        i=1
        j=n
        while j>0:
            mid=(i+j)//2
            ans=mid*mid
            if (ans)==n:
                return mid
            elif ans>n:
                if (mid-1)*(mid-1)<n:
                   return mid-1
                else:
                    j=mid-1
            else:
                i=mid+1
```
