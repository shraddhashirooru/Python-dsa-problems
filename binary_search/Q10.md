## âœ…Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def floorSqrt(self, n): 
        i=1
        j=n
        final=0
        while i<=j:
            mid=(i+j)//2
            ans=mid*mid
            if (ans)==n:
                return mid
            elif ans<n:
                final=mid
                i=mid+1
            else:
                j=mid-1
        return final
```
