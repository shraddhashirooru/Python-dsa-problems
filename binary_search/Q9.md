# Question 9: Binary search in forest:

## There are n trees in a forest. The heights of the trees is stored in array tree[], where tree[i] denotes the height of the ith tree in the forest. If the ith tree is cut at a height H, then the wood collected is tree[i] - H, provided tree[i] > H. If the total woods that needs to be collected is exactly equal to k, find the height H at which every tree should be cut (all trees have to be cut at the same height). If it is not possible then return -1 else return H.

### Example 1:

Input:

n = 5, k = 4

tree[] = {2, 3, 6, 2, 4}

Output: 3

Explanation: Wood collected by cutting trees at height 3 = 0 + 0 + (6-3) + 0 + (4-3) = 4 hence 3 is to be subtracted from all numbers. Since 2 is lesser than 3, nothing gets subtracted from it.

## ✅Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def find_height(self,tree,n,k):
        
        def numwood(tree,mid,k):
            sum1=0
            for i in tree:
                if i>mid:
                    sum1=sum1+(i-mid)
            return sum1
        
        i=1
        j=max(tree)-1
        
        while i<=j:
            mid=(i+j)//2
            a=numwood(tree,mid,k)
            if a==k:
                return mid
            elif a<k:
                j=mid-1
            else:
                i=mid+1
        return -1
```
