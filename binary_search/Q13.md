# Question 13: Finding upper bound:

## Given a sorted array arr[] and a number target, the task is to find the upper bound of the target in this given array. The upper bound of a number is defined as the smallest index in the sorted array where the element is greater than the given number.
Note: If all the elements in the given array are smaller than or equal to the target, the upper bound will be the length of the array.

---
### Examples :

Input:  arr[] = [2, 3, 7, 10, 11, 11, 25], target = 9

Output: 3

Explanation: 3 is the smallest index in arr[], at which element (arr[3] = 10) is larger than 9.

## âœ…Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def upperBound(self, arr, target):
        n=len(arr)
        ans=n
        i=0
        j=n-1
        while i<=j:
            mid=(i+j)//2
            if arr[mid]>target:
                ans=mid
                j=mid-1
            else:
                i=mid+1
        return ans
```
