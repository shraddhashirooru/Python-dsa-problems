# Question 51: Join two linked lists:

## Given two linked lists of size n1 and n2 respectively, you have to join the head of second list to the tail of first so that we can traverse both the lists using head of 1st list.

### Example 1:

Input:

LinkedList1: 5

LinkedList2: 1->2

Output: 5 1 2

## âœ…Python code:

```

def joinTheLists(head1, head2):
    current=head1
    while current.next:
        current=current.next
    current.next=head2
    return head1
```
