# Question 8: Finding modular node:

## Given the head of a Singly Linked List and a number k, the task is to find the modular node of the linked list. If no such index is present return -1. A modular node is defined as the last node in the linked list whose index is divisible by k (i%k==0). 
Note: 1-based indexing is followed

---
### Examples :

Input: LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5->6->7 , k = 3
  
Output: 6

Explanation: Indexing of the linked list is same as the values of the Node. The maximum index which is divisble by 3 is 6 and the node value of the 6th index is 6.

## âœ…Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def modularNode(self, head, k):
        current=head
        count=0
        final=-1
        while current:
            count+=1
            if count%k==0:
                final=current.data
            current=current.next
        return final
```
