# Question 18: Last in last out stack using linked list:

## Let's give it a try! You have a linked list and must implement the functionalities push and pop of stack using this given linked list. Your task is to use the class as shown in the comments in the code editor and complete the functions push() and pop() to implement a stack. 

The push() method takes one argument, an integer 'x' to be pushed into the stack and pop() which returns an integer present at the top and popped out from the stack. If the stack is empty then return -1 from the pop() method.

Note: The input is given in the form of queries. Since there are two operations push() and pop(), there is two types of queries as described below:

(i) 1   (a query of this type takes x as another parameter and pushes it into the stack)

(ii) 2  (a query of this type means to pop an element from the stack and return the popped element)

Input is separated by space and as described above.

### Examples :

Input: [[1,2], [1,3], [2], [1,4], [2]]

Output: [3, 4]

Explanation: 

push(2)  : the stack will be {2}

push(3)  : the stack will be {2 3}

pop()    : poped element will be 3,the stack will be {2}

push(4)  : the stack will be {2 4}

pop()    : poped element will be 4

## âœ…Python code: 

```
def __init__(self):
        self.head=None
    def push(self, data):
        new_node=StackNode(data)
        if self.head is None:
            self.head=new_node
            return self.head
        current=self.head
        while current.next:
            current=current.next
        current.next=new_node
        return self.head
    #Function to remove an item from top of the stack.
    def pop(self):
        if self.head is None:
            return -1
        if self.head.next is None:
            popped=self.head.data
            self.head=None
            return popped
        current=self.head
        while current.next.next:
            current=current.next
        popped=current.next.data
        current.next=None
        return popped
```
