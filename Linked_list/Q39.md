# Question 39: Delete N nodes after M nodes of a linked lists:

## Given a linked list, delete n nodes after skipping m nodes of a linked list until the last of the linked list.
---
### Examples:

Input: Linked List: 9->1->3->5->9->4->10->1, n = 1, m = 2
 
Output: 9->1->5->9->10->1
 
Explanation: Deleting 1 node after skipping 2 nodes each time, we have list as 9-> 1-> 5-> 9-> 10-> 1.

## âœ… Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def linkdelete(self, head, n, m):
        current=head
        prev=None
        m1=0
        while current:
            if m1==m:
                for i in range(n-1):
                    if current.next:
                        current=current.next
                prev.next=current.next
                current=prev.next
                m1=-1
            else:
                prev=current
                current=current.next
            m1+=1
        return head
```
