# Question 29: Count pairs who sum is equal to X:

## Given two linked lists head1 and head2 with distinct elements, determine the count of all distinct pairs from both lists whose sum equals the given value x.
Note: A valid pair would be in the form (x, y) where x is from the first linked list and y is from the second linked list. (1, 3) and (3, 1) are considered different.

---
### Examples:

Input: head1 = 1->2->3->4->5->6, head2 = 11->12->13, x = 15

Output: 3

Explanation: There are total 3 pairs whose sum is 15 : (4,11) , (3,12) and (2,13)

## âœ…Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def countPairs(self, head1, head2, x):
        current=head2
        a=set()
        while current:
            a.add(current.data)
            current=current.next
        count=0
        current=head1
        while current:
            if x-current.data in a:
                count+=1
            current=current.next
        return count
```
