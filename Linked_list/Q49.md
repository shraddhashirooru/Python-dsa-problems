# Question 49: Merge lists alternatively:

## Given two linked lists head1 and head2, your task is to complete the function mergeList() which inserts nodes of the second list into the first list at alternate positions of the first list and leaves the remaining nodes as it is if they cannot be inserted.
The function should return an array containing the two modified linked list heads in their original order.

### Examples:

Input: LinkedList1 = 10->9 , LinkedList2 = 6->1->2->3->4->5

Output: LinkedList1 = 10->6->9->1 , LinkedList2 = 2->3->4->5

Explanation: The two linked list are 10->9 and 6->1->2->3->4->5. After merging the two lists as required, the new list is like: 10->6->9->1 and  2->3->4->5.

## âœ…Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def merge_list(self, head1, head2):
        current1=head1
        current2=head2
        temp1=head1
        temp2=head2
        while current1 and current2:
            temp1=current1.next
            current1.next=temp2
            temp2=temp2.next
            current1.next.next=temp1
            current1=temp1
            current2=temp2
        return head1,temp2
```
