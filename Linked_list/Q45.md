# Question 45: Compare two linked lists :

## Given two strings, head1 and head2, represented as linked lists where each character is stored in a node's data field, complete the function compare() that mimics the behavior of strcmp(). Specifically, the function should return:

•	0 if both strings are identical,

•	1 if the first linked list is lexicographically greater, and

•	-1 if the second linked list is lexicographically greater.

---
### Examples:

Input: head1 = a->b->a->b->a , head2 = a->b->a->a

Output: 1

Explanation: String consisting of nodes of first linked list is lexicographically greater than the second one. So, the result is 1.

## ✅Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def compare(self, head1, head2):
        current1=head1
        current2=head2
        s1=""
        s2=""
        while current1 or current2:
            if current1:
                s1+=current1.data
                current1=current1.next
            if current2:
                s2+=current2.data
                current2=current2.next
        if s1==s2:
            return 0
        elif s1<s2:
            return -1
        else:
            return 1
```
