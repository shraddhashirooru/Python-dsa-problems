## âœ…Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def deleteK(self, head, k):
        if k<=1:
            head=None
            return head
        #code here  
        current=head
        prev=None
        count=0
        while current:
            count+=1
            if count==k:
                temp=current.next
                prev.next=current.next
                current=temp
                count=0
            else:
                prev=current
                current=current.next
        return head
```
