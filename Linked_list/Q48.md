# Question 48: Move all zeros to the front of the liked list:

## Given a linked list, the task is to move all 0s to the front of the linked list. The order of all other elements except 0 should be the same after rearrangement.

### Examples:

Input:  0 -> 4 -> 0 -> 5 -> 0

Output: 0 -> 0 -> 0 -> 4 -> 5

Explanation: After moving all 0s of the given list to the front, the list is: 0 -> 0 -> 0 -> 4 -> 5
