# Question 62: Remove all occurrences of duplicates in a linked list:

## Given a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers (all occurrences), leaving only numbers that appear once in the original list, and return the head of the modified linked list. 

### Examples:

Input: Linked List = 23->28->28->35->49->49->53->53

Output: 23 35

The duplicate numbers are 28, 49 and 53 which are removed from the list.

## âœ…Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def removeAllDuplicates(self, head):
        current=head
        prev=None
        while current:
            temp=current.next
            if temp and current.data==temp.data:
                while temp and current.data==temp.data:
                    temp=temp.next
                if prev:
                    prev.next=temp
                else:
                    head=temp
            else:
                prev=current
            current=temp        

        return head
```
