# Question 14: Remove duplicates from an unsorted list:

## Given an unsorted linked list. The task is to remove duplicate elements from this unsorted Linked List. When a value appears in multiple nodes, the node which appeared first should be kept, all other duplicates are to be removed.

### Examples:

Input: LinkedList: 5->2->2->4

Output: 5->2->4

Explanation: Given linked list elements are 5->2->2->4, in which 2 is repeated only. So, we will delete the extra repeated elements 2 from the linked list and the resultant linked list will contain 5->2->4

    #Function to remove duplicates from unsorted linked list.
    def removeDuplicates(self, head):
        a=set()
        prev=head
        current=head.next
        a.add(head.data)
        while current:
            if current.data in a:
                temp=current.next
                prev.next=current.next
                current=temp
            else:
                a.add(current.data)
                prev=current
