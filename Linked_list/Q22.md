# Question 22: Intersection sorted linked lists:

## Given that two linked lists are sorted in increasing order, create a new linked list representing the intersection of the two linked lists. The new linked list should be made without changing the original lists.
Note: The elements of the linked list are not necessarily distinct.

---
### Examples:

Input: LinkedList1 = 1->2->3->4->6, LinkedList2 = 2->4->6->8

Output: 2->4->6

Explanation: For the given two linked list, 2, 4 and 6 are the elements in the intersection.

## âœ…Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def findIntersection(self,head1,head2):
        dummy=Node(0)
        current1=head1
        current2=head2
        current=dummy
        while current1 and current2:
            if current1.data==current2.data:
                current.next=Node(current1.data)
                current=current.next
                
                current1=current1.next
                current2=current2.next
            elif current1.data<current2.data:
                current1=current1.next
            else:
                current2=current2.next
        
        head=dummy.next
        return head
```
