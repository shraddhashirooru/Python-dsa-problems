## âœ…Python code:

```
class Solution:
    #Function to check whether two linked lists are identical or not.
    def areIdentical(self, head1, head2):
        current1=head1
        current2=head2
        while current1 or current2:
            if current1.data!=current2.data:
                return False
            current1=current1.next
            current2=current2.next
        return True        
```
