# Question 9: Convert doubly linked list to array:

## Given a doubly linked list of n elements. The task is to return the doubly linked list as an array.
Note: The driver code will print the list forward and backward.

### Examples:

Input: LinkedList: 1<->2<->3<->4<->5

Output:

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

Explanation: After traversing forward the linked list will look like [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and from backward will [5, 4, 3, 2, 1].

## âœ…Python code:

```
def displayList(head):
    current=head
    arr=[]
    while current:
        arr.append(current.data)
        current=current.next
    return arr
```
