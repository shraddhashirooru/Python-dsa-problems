# Question 19: Check whether circular linked list or not:

## Given the head, the head of a singly linked list, Returns true if the linked list is circular & false if it is not circular. A linked list is called circular if it is not NULL terminated and all nodes are connected in the form of a cycle. 
Note: The linked list does not contain any inner loop.

### Examples:

Input: 

<img width="625" height="219" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2348d334-4da3-4b86-95aa-346a9329b385" />

 
Output: true

Explanation: As shown in figure the first and last node is connected, i.e. 5 --> 2

## âœ…Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def isCircular(self, head):
        current=head.next
        current1=head
        while current:
            if current1==current:
                return True
            current=current.next
        return False
```
