# Question 37: Find common data in two linked list and make a linked list out of it: (intersection of two linked list)

## Given two linked lists head1 and head2, find the intersection of two linked lists. Each of the two linked lists contains distinct node values.
Note: The order of nodes in this list should be the same as the order in which those particular nodes appear in input head1 and return null if no common element is present.

### Examples:

Input: LinkedList1: 9->6->4->2->3->8 , LinkedList2: 1->2->8->6

Output: 6->2->8

Explanation: Nodes 6, 2 and 8 are common in both of the lists and the order will be according to LinkedList1. 

##  âœ…Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def findIntersection(self, head1, head2):
        head=None
        s=set()
        while head2:
            s.add(head2.data)
            head2=head2.next
        while head1:
            if head1.data in s:
                if head is None:
                    head=Node(head1.data)
                    current=head
                else:
                    new_node=Node(head1.data)
                    current.next=new_node
                    current=new_node
            head1=head1.next
        return head
