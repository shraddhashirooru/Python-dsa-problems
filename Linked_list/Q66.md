# Question 66: Triplets in sorted linked list:

## Given a sorted linked list of distinct nodes (no two nodes have the same data) and an integer x. Count distinct triplets in the list that sum up to a given integer x.
Note: The Linked List is sorted in descending order.

### Examples:

Input: LinkedList: 9->8->6->5->4->2->1,  x= 17

Output: 2

Explanation: Distinct triplets are (2, 6, 9) and (4, 5, 8) which have sum equal to x i.e 17.

## âœ…Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def countTriplets(self,head,x):
        current1=head
        count=0
        while current1:
            d={}
            current2=current1.next
            while current2:
                ans=x-(current1.data+current2.data)
                if ans in d:
                    count+=1
                else:
                    d[current2.data]=d.get(current2.data,0)+1
                current2=current2.next
            current1=current1.next
        return count
```
