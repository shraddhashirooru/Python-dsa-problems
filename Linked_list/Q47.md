# Question 47: Reverse both parts before k and after k:

## Given a linked list and a number k. You have to reverse the first part of the linked list with k nodes and the second part with n-k nodes.

### Examples:

Input: Linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5,  k = 2

Output: 2 -> 1 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3

Explanation: As k = 2 , so the first part 2 nodes: 1 -> 2 and the second part with 3 nodes: 3 -> 4 -> 5. Now after reversing the first part: 2 -> 1 and the second part: 5 -> 4 -> 3. So the output is: 2 -> 1 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3

## âœ…Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def reverse(self, head : Optional['Node'], k : int) -> Optional['Node']:
        current=head
        prev=None
        count=0
        while True:
            if count==k:
                break
            temp=current.next
            current.next=prev
            prev=current
            current=temp
            count+=1
        second=prev
        current=temp
        prev=None
        while current:
            temp1=current.next
            current.next=prev
            prev=current
            current=temp1
        head.next=prev
        head=second
        return head
        # code here
```
