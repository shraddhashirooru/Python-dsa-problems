# Question 36: Find decimal equivalent of binary linked list:

## Given a singly linked list. The link list represents a binary number, ie- it contains only 0s and 1s. Find its decimal equivalent.
The significance of the bits decreases with the increasing index in the linked list. An empty linked list is considered to represent the decimal value 0. 
Since the answer can be very large, the answer modulo 10^9+7 should be returned.

### Examples:

Input: Linked List = 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0
 
Output: 14

Explanation: 1*23 + 1*22 + 1*21 + 0*20 =  8 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 14

## âœ…Python code:

```
class Solution:

    def decimalValue(self, head):
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        ans=0
        current=head
        while current:
            ans=ans*2+current.data
            current=current.next
        return ans%MOD
```
