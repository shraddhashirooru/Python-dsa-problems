# Question 17: Delete in Doubly linked list:

## Given a Doubly Linked list and a position. The task is to delete a node from a given position (position starts from 1) in a doubly linked list and return the head of the doubly Linked list.

---
## Examples:

Input: LinkedList = 1 <--> 3 <--> 4, x = 3

Output: 1 <--> 3

Explanation: After deleting the node at position 3 (position starts from 1),the linked list will be now as 1 <--> 3.

## âœ…Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def delete_node(self, head, x):
        if x==1:
            head=head.next
            if head:
                head.prev=None
            return head
        current=head
        count=0
        prev=None
        while current:
            count+=1
            if count==x:
                new_node=current.next
                prev.next=new_node
                if new_node is not None:
                    new_node.prev=prev
                break
            prev=current
            current=current.next
        return head
```
