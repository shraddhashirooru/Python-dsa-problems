# Question 43: Splits linked list alternatively:

## Given a singly linked list's head. Your task is to complete the function alternatingSplitList() that splits the given linked list into two smaller lists. The sublists should be made from alternating elements from the original list.

Note: 

•	The sublist should be in the order with respect to the original list.

•	You have to return an array containing the both sub-linked lists.

### Examples:

Input: LinkedList = 0->1->0->1->0->1

Output: 0->0->0 , 1->1->1

Explanation: After forming two sublists of the given list as required, we have two lists as: 0->0->0 and 1->1->1.

## ✅Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def alternatingSplitList(self, head):
        dummy=Node(0)
        current=head
        second=dummy
        while current and current.next:
            temp=current.next
            current.next=current.next.next
            second.next=temp
            second=second.next
            current=current.next
        second.next=None
        head2=dummy.next
        return head, head2
```
