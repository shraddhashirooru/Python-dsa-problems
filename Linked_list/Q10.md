# Question 10: Even or odd nodes:

# Given a linked list, your task is to complete the function isLengthEven() which contains the head of the linked list, and check whether the length of the linked list is even or not. Return true if it is even, otherwise false.

---
### Examples:

Input: Linked list: 12->52->10->47->95->0
 
Output: true

Explanation: The length of the linked list is 6 which is even, hence returned true.

---
## âœ…Python code:

```
class Solution:
    # your task is to complete this function
    # function should return false if length is even
    # else return true
    def isLengthEven(self, head):
        current=head
    
        count=0
        while current:
            count+=1
            current=current.next
        return (count)%2==0
```
