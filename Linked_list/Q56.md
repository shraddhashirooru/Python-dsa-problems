# Question 56: Intersection of nodes starts in Y shaped lists:

## Given the head of two singly linked lists, return the point where these two linked lists intersect.
Note: It is guaranteed that the intersected node always exists.

Custom Input Format:

head1 contains the nodes before intersection in list1

head2 contains the nodes before intersection in list2

CommonList contains the nodes after intersection of list1 and list2.

### Examples:

Input: head1 : 4 -> 4 -> 4 -> 4 -> 4, head2 : 4 -> 4 -> 4

Output: 4

Explanation: From the above image, it is clearly seen that the common part is 4 -> 4 whose starting point is 4.

## âœ…Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def intersectPoint(self, head1, head2):
        s=set()
        current2=head2
        while current2:
            s.add(current2)
            current2=current2.next
        current1=head1
        while current1:
            if current1 in s:
                return current1
            current1=current1.next
```
