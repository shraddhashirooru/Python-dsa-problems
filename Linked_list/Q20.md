# Question 20: Deletes nodes having greater value on right:

## Given a singly linked list, remove all nodes that have a node with a greater value anywhere to their right in the list. Return the head of the modified linked list.

### Examples:

Input:

LinkedList = 12->15->10->11->5->6->2->3

Output: 15->11->6->3

Explanation: Since, 12, 10, 5 and 2 are the elements which have greater elements on the following nodes. So, after deleting them, the linked list would like be 15, 11, 6, 3.

    def compute(self,head):
        def reverse(head):
            current=head
            prev=None

        head=reverse(head)
        current=head

                current=current.next
        return reverse(head)
```
