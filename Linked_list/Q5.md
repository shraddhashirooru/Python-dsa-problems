# Question 5: Search in Linked list:

## You are given a singly linked list of n elements, and also an element x. You need to find if x is present in the linked list or not. Return true if x is present else returns false. (1 is printed by the driver code if the returned value is true, otherwise 0)

---
### Examples :

Input: LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5, x = 4

Output: 1

Input: LinkedList: 2->4->6->7->5->1->0, x = 10

Output: 0

## âœ…Python code:

```
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
'''
def searchLinkedList(head,x):
    current=head
    while current:
        if current.data==x:
            return 1
        current=current.next
    return 0
```
