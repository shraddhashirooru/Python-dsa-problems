# Question 40: Find n/k the node in a linked list:

## Given a singly linked list and a number k. Find the (n/k)th element, where n is the number of elements in the linked list. We need to consider ceil value in case of decimals.

---
### Examples:

Input: LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5->6 , k = 2

Output: 3

Explanation: 6/2th element is the 3rd(1-based indexing) element which is 3.

## âœ…Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def fractional_node(self, head, k):
        slow=None
        fast=head
        i=0
        while fast:
            if i%k==0:
                if slow is None:
                    slow=head
                else:
                    slow=slow.next
            fast=fast.next
            i=i+1
        return slow.data
```
