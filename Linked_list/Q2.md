class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head=None
        self.tail=None
        '''
class Solution:
    # Function to count nodes of a linked list.
    def getCount(self, head):
        if head is None:
            return 0
        current=head
        count=1
        while current.next:
            count=count+1
            current=current.next
        return count
```
