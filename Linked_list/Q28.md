# Question 28: Remove duplicates from sorted linked list :

## Given a singly linked list. The task is to remove duplicates (nodes with duplicate values) from the given list (if it exists).
Note: Try not to use extra space. The nodes are arranged in a sorted way.

### Examples:

Input:

LinkedList: 2->2->4->5

Output: 2 -> 4 -> 5

Explanation: In the given linked list 2 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5, only 2 occurs more than 1 time. So we need to remove it once.

## âœ…Python code:

```
def removeDuplicates(head):
    prev=head
    current=head.next
    while current:
        if prev and current and prev.data==current.data:
            prev.next=current.next
            current=current.next
            continue
        prev=current
        current=current.next
    return head
```
