# Question 55: Add 1 to linked list number:

# You are given a linked list where each element in the list is a node and have an integer data. You need to add 1 to the number formed by concatinating all the list node numbers together and return the head of the modified linked list. 
Note: The head represents the first element of the given array.

### Examples :

Input: LinkedList: 4->5->6

Output: 457

Explanation: 4->5->6 represents 456 and when 1 is added it becomes 457. 

## âœ…Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def addOne(self,head):
        
        def reverse(head):
            current=head
            prev=None
            while current:
                new_node=current.next
                current.next=prev
                prev=current
                current=new_node
            head=prev
            return head
        head=reverse(head)
        current=head
        carry=1
        while current.next:
            a=current.data+carry
            if a>9:
                carry=1
            else:
                carry=0
            current.data=a%10
            current=current.next
        current.data=current.data+carry
            
        return reverse(head)
```
