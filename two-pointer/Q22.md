# Question 22: Number of subarrays with maximum values in given range :

## Given an array of N elements and L and R, print the number of sub-arrays such that the value of the maximum array element in that subarray is at least L and at most R.

---
### Example 1:
Input : 
Arr = {2, 0, 11, 3, 0}
L = 1 and R = 10
Output : 
4
Explanation:
The sub-arrays {2}, {2, 0}, {3} and {3, 0} have maximum in range 1-10.

## âœ… Python code:

```
        i=0
        j=0
        mx=float("-inf")
        count=0
        length=0
        while j<n:
            
            if arr[j]>=L and arr[j]<=R:
                length=j-i+1
                j=j+1
            elif arr[j]<L:
                j=j+1
            else:
                length=0
                i=j+1
                j=i
            count=count+length
        return count   
```
