# Question 21: Triplet with smaller sum:

## Given an array arr[] of distinct integers of size n and a value sum, the task is to find the count of triplets (i, j, k), having (i<j<k) with the sum of (arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k]) smaller than the given value sum.

---
### Examples :
Input: n = 4, sum = 2, arr[] = {-2, 0, 1, 3}
Output:  2
Explanation: Below are triplets with sum less than 2 (-2, 0, 1) and (-2, 0, 3).

## âœ… Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def countTriplets(self, n, sum, arr):
        count=0
        arr.sort()
        for i in range(n-2):
            j=i+1
            k=n-1
            while j<k:
                sum1=arr[i]+arr[j]+arr[k]
                if sum1<sum:
                    count=count+k-j
                    j=j+1
                else:
                    k=k-1
        return count
```
