# Question 4: Check palindrome or not after removing special characters:

## Given a single string s, the task is to check if it is a palindrome sentence or not. A palindrome sentence is a sequence of characters, such as word, phrase, or series of symbols that reads the same backward as forward after converting all uppercase letters to lowercase and removing all non-alphanumeric characters.

### Examples:
Input: s = "Too hot to hoot"
Output: true
Explanation: If we remove all non-alphanumeric characters and convert all uppercase letters to lowercase, string s will become “toohottohoot” which is a palindrome.

## ✅ Python code:

```
class Solution:
	def sentencePalindrome(self, s):
	   n=len(s)
	   s=s.lower()
	   i=0
	   j=n-1
	   while i<j:
	       if not s[i].isalnum():
	           i=i+1
	       elif not s[j].isalnum():
	           j=j-1
	       else:
	           if s[i]!=s[j]:
	               return False
	           else:
	               i=i+1
	               j=j-1
	   return True
```
