# Question 18: Closet sum to target:

## Given an array, arr of integers, and another number target, find three integers in the array such that their sum is closest to the target. Return the sum of the three integers.
Note: If there are multiple solutions, return the maximum one.

### Examples :

Input: arr[] = [-7, 9, 8, 3, 1, 1], target = 2

Output: 2

Explanation: There is only one triplet present in the array where elements are -7,8,1 whose sum is 2.

Input: arr[] = [5, 2, 7, 5], target = 13

Output: 14

Explanation: There is one triplet with sum 12 and other with sum 14 in the array. Triplet elements are 5, 2, 5 and 2, 7, 5 respectively. Since abs(13-12) ==abs(13-14) maximum triplet sum will be preferred i.e 14.

## ✅ Python code 1:

```
class Solution:
    def threeSumClosest (self, arr, target):
        arr.sort()
        n=len(arr)
        d={}
        for i in range(n-2):
            j=i+1
            k=n-1
            while j<k:
                sum1=arr[i]+arr[j]+arr[k]
                if sum1==target:
                    return sum1
                elif sum1<target:
                    diff=abs(target-sum1)
                    if diff in d:
                        sum1=max(d[diff],sum1)
                    d[diff]=sum1
                    j=j+1
                else:
                    diff=abs(target-sum1)
                    if diff in d:
                        sum1=max(d[diff],sum1)
                    d[diff]=sum1
                    k=k-1
        return d[min(d)]
```

## ✅ Python code 2:

```
class Solution:
    def closest3Sum(self, arr, target):
        dif1 = float(“inf”)
        arr.sort()
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            left = i + 1
            right = len(arr) - 1
            while left<right:
                sum1 = arr[i] + arr[left] + arr[right]
                dif2 = abs(sum1 - target)
                
                if dif2==dif1 and ans<sum1:
                    dif1=dif2
                    ans=sum1
                if dif2 < dif1:
                    dif1 = dif2
                    ans = sum1
                if sum1 > target:
                    right=right-1
                else:
                    left=left+1
        return ans
