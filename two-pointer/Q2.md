# Question 2: Dominant pairs

## You are given an array of integers of size n where n being even.. You have to calculate the number of dominate pairs (i,j) . Where a pair is called dominant if ( 0<=i<n/2, n/2<=j<n, arr[i]>=5*arr[j] ) these relation are fulfilled.  For example  in arr=[10,3,3,1] index i=0, j=3 form a dominating pair
Note : 0 based indexing is used  and n is even

### Example 1:

Input:

n=4

arr={10,2,2,1}

Output:

2

Explanation:

As we can see index i=0 and j=2 where arr[0]>=5*arr[2] (10>=5*2)is fulfilled so this forms a dominant pair and in same manner index i=0 and j=3 forms dominant pair.So total 2 dominant pairs.

## âœ… Python code:

```
from typing import List
class Solution:
    def dominantPairs(self, n : int, arr : List[int]) -> int:
        m=n//2
        a=arr[:m]
        b=arr[m:n]
        a.sort()
        b.sort()
        i=m-1
        j=m-1
        count=0
        while i>=0 and j>=0:
            
            if a[i]>=5*b[j]:
                count=count+j+1
                i=i-1
            else:
                j=j-1
        return count
```
