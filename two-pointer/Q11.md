# Question 11: Finding a pair which is near to target:

## Given an array arr[] and an integer target. You have to find a pair in an array whose sum is closest to target.
Note: Return the pair in sorted order and if there are multiple such pairs return the pair with maximum absolute difference. If no such pair exists return an empty array.

### Examples:

Input: arr[] = [40, 10, 29, 28, 22, 1, 30], target = 54 
Output: [22, 30]

Explanation: The pair 22 and 30 sums to 52 which is the closest sum to 54.

    #Complete the below function
    def closestPairSum(self,arr, target):
        arr.sort()
        n=len(arr)
        i=0
        j=n-1
        d={}
        while i<j:
            sum1=arr[i]+arr[j]
            diff=abs(target-sum1)
            if diff not in d:
                d[diff]=[arr[i],arr[j]]
            if sum1==target:
                return d[diff]
            elif sum1<target:
                i=i+1
            else:
                j=j-1
        if d:
            return d[min(d)]
        else:
            return []
