# Question 2: G.F.series

## Siddhant made a special series and named it as G.F Series. The series follows this trend  Tn=(Tn-2)2-(Tn-1)  in which the first and the second term are 0 and 1 respectively. Help Siddhant to find the first n terms of the series.

## Note: Print a white space (" ") after every integer and a newline character after every testcase.

### Examples
Input: n = 3
Output: 0 1 -1

Explanation: First-term is given as 0 and the second term is 1. So the T3 = (T3-2)2 - (T3-1) = T12 - T2 = 02 - 1 = -1

```
class Solution:
    def gfSeries(self, N : int) -> None:
        def first(N,dp):
            if N==1:
                dp[N]=0
                return dp[N]
            if N==2:
                dp[N]=1
                return dp[N]
            if dp[N] is not None:
                return dp[N]
            dp[N]=(first((N-2),dp))**2-first(N-1,dp)
            return dp[N]
        dp=[None]*(N+1)
        first(N,dp)
        s=list(map(str,dp[1:]))
        print(" ".join(s))
