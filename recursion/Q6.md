# Question 6: List of Fibonacci Series :

## You are given an integer n, return the fibonacci series till the nth(0-based indexing) term. Since the terms can become very large return the terms modulo 109+7.

### Example 1:

Input:

n = 5

Output:

0 1 1 2 3 5

Explanation:

0 1 1 2 3 5 is the Fibonacci series up to the 5th term.

### âœ… Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def series(self, n):
        MOD=10**9+7
        def fib(n):
            if n==0:
                return dp[n]
            elif n==1:
                return dp[n]
            if dp[n] is not None:
                return dp[n]
            dp[n]=(fib(n-2)+fib(n-1))%MOD
            return dp[n]
        dp=[None]*(n+1)
        dp[0]=0
        dp[1]=1
        fib(n)
        return dp
```
