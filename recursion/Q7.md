# Question 7: Divisor Game:

## Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first. Initially, there is a number n on the chalkboard. On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of:
•	Choosing any x with 0 < x < n  and n % x == 0.
•	Replacing the number n on the chalkboard with n - x.
Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.
Return true if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.

### Example 1:

Input:

n = 2

Output: True

Explanation: Alice chooses 1, and Bob has no more moves.

## ✅ Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def divisorGame(self, n):
        def div(n):
            if n==0:
                dp[n]=0
                return dp[n]
            if n==1:
                dp[n]=1
                return dp[n]
            dp[n]=div(n-2)
            return dp[n]
        dp=[None]*(n+1)
        dp[n]=div(n-1)
        return dp[n]
or
        if n%2==0:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
