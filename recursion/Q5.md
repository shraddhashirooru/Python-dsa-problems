# Question 5: Printing pattern of n-5 to n<=0 and then n+5 to n:

## Print a sequence of numbers starting with n, without using a loop. Replace n with n - 5, n−5... until n≤0. Then, replace n with n+5, n + 5, n+5 until n regains its initial value. Complete the function pattern(n) which takes n as input and returns a list containing the pattern.

---

### Examples

Input: n = 16

Output: 16 11 6 1 -4 1 6 11 16

Explanation: The value decreases until it is greater than 0. After that it increases and stops when it becomes 16 again.

## ✅ Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def pattern(self, N):
        m=N
        def negative(N):
            if N>=m:
                return
            else:
                a.append(N+5)
                negative(N+5)
                return N
        def positive(N):
            if N<=0:
                return negative(N)
            else:
                a.append(N-5)
                positive(N-5)
                return N
        a=[]
        a.append(N)
        positive(N)
        return a
```
