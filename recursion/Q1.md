# Question 1: Print 1 to N without loop:

## **Print numbers from 1 to n without the help of loops. You only need to complete the function printNos() that takes n as a parameter and prints the number from 1 to n recursively.**

## Note: Don't print any newline, it will be added by the driver code.

---

### Examples:

Input: n = 10

Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

---

## âœ… Python code:

```
class Solution:    
    #Complete this function
    def printNos(self,n):
        if n==1:
            print(1,end=" ")
            return 1
        a=self.printNos(n-1)+1
        print(a,end=" ")
        return a
```
