# Question 11: Encrypting substring :

## You are given a string S. Every sub-string of identical letters is replaced by a single instance of that letter followed by the hexadecimal representation of the number of occurrences of that letter. Then, the string thus obtained is further encrypted by reversing it [ See the sample for more clarity ]. Print the Encrypted String. Note: All Hexadecimal letters should be converted to Lowercase letters.

---

### Example 1:

Input:

S = "aaaaaaaaaaa"

Output:

ba 

Explanation: 

aaaaaaaaaaa

Step1: a11 (a occurs 11 times)

Step2: a11 is ab [since 11 is b in hexadecimal]

Step3: ba [After reversing]

## âœ… Python code:

```
from collections import Counter
class Solution:
    def encryptString(self, S):
        x=[]
        n=len(S)
        count=0
        for i in range(n-1):
            if S[i]==S[i+1]:
                count=count+1
            else:
                x.append(S[i])
                x.append(hex(count+1)[2:])
                count=0
        x.append(S[n-1])
        x.append(hex(count+1)[2:])
       
        return "".join(x[::-1])
```
