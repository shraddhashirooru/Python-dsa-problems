# Question 9: Is it possible to attend all meeting:

## Given an array arr[][] such that arr[i][0] is the starting time of ith meeting and arr[i][1] is the ending time of ith meeting, the task is to check if it is possible for a person to attend all the meetings such that he can attend only one meeting at a particular time.
Note: A person can attend a meeting if its starting time is greater than or equal to the previous meeting's ending time.

### Examples:
Input: arr[][] = [[1, 4], [10, 15], [7, 10]]
Output: true
Explanation: Since all the meetings are held at different times, it is possible to attend all the meetings.

## âœ… Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def canAttend(self,arr):
        arr.sort(key=lambda x:x[1])
        n=len(arr)
        for i in range(n-1):
            if arr[i][1]<=arr[i+1][0]:
                continue
            else:
                return False
        return True
```
