# Question 10: Smallest number with sum of digits as N and divisible by 10^N:

## Find the smallest number such that the sum of its digits is N and it is divisible by 10N.

---

### Example 1:

Input: N = 5

Outptut: 500000

Explanation: Sum of digits of 500000 is 5 and divisible by 105.

Example 2:

Input: N = 20

Output: 29900000000000000000000

Explanation: Sum of digits of 29900000000000000000000 is 20 and divisible by 1020.

## âœ… Python code:

```
import sys
class Solution:
    
	def digitsNum(self, N):
	   sys.set_int_max_str_digits(10000000)
	   a=""
	   n=N
	   if N<=9:
	       return N*(10**N)
	   for i in range(2,N//2):
	       m=N/i
	       if m<=9:
	           s=i
	           break 
	   for i in range(s):
	        if N>=9:
	            a=a+"9"
	            N=N-9
	        else:
	            a=a+str(N)
	            N=0
	   return int(a[::-1])*(10**n)
```
