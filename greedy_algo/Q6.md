# Question 6 (i): Largest number possible:

## Given two numbers n and s , find the largest number that can be formed with n digits and whose sum of digits should be equals to s. Return -1 if it is not possible.

---

### Examples :
Input: n = 2, s = 9
Output: 90
Explaination: It is the biggest number with sum of digits equals to 9.

---

## ✅ Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def findLargest(self, n, s):
        a=""
        if s<1 and n>1:
            return -1
        for i in range(n):
            if s>=9:
                s=s-9
                a=a+"9"
            else:
                a=a+str(s)
                s=0
        if s!=0:
            return -1
        else:
            return a
```

# ii. Largest number with given sum

## Geek lost the password of his super locker. He remembers the number of digits N as well as the sum S of all the digits of his password. He know that his password is the largest number of N digits that can be made with given sum S. As he is busy doing his homework, help him retrieving his password.

---

### Example 1:
Input:

N = 5, S = 12

Output:

93000

Explanation:

Sum of elements is 12. Largest possible 5 digit number is 93000 with sum 12.

## ✅ Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def largestNum(self,n,s):
        a=""
        for i in range(n):
            if s>=9:
                a=a+"9"
                s=s-9
            else:
                a=a+str(s)
                s=0
        if s!=0:
            return -1
        else:
            return a
```
