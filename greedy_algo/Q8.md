# Question 8: Ticket Counter:

## N people from 1 to N are standing in the queue at a movie ticket counter. It is a weird counter, as it distributes tickets to the first K people and then the last K people and again first K people and so on, once a person gets a ticket moves out of the queue. The task is to find the last person to get the ticket.

### Example 1

Input:

N = 9

K = 3

Output:

6

Explanation:

Starting queue will like {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. After the first distribution queue will look like {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. And after the second distribution queue will look like {4, 5, 6}. The last person to get the ticket will be 6.

## âœ… Python code:

```
from collections import deque
class Solution:
    def distributeTicket(self, N : int, K : int) -> int:
        arr=list(range(1,N+1))
        a=deque()
        a.extend(arr)
        count=0
        x=[]
        def start(N,K,count,x):
            for i in range(K):
                if count==N:
                    return x[-1]
                x.append(a.popleft())
                count=count+1
            return end(N,K,count,x)
        def end(N,K,count,x):
            for i in range(K):
                if count==N:
                    return x[-1]
                x.append(a.pop())
                count=count+1
            return start(N,K,count,x)
        return start(N,K,count,x)
```
