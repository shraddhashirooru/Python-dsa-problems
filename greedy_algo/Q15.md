# Question 15: Possible number of elements sum less than k :

## Given an array of integers a of length n and a value k. You have to find out the maximum possible numbers within 109whose sum does not exceed k but are not present in the array.

---

### Example 1:

Input: n = 4, 
       k = 14,
       a = {4, 6, 12, 8}

Output: 4

Explaination: The integers 1, 2, 3 and 5.

### âœ… Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def maxNumbers(self, n, k, a):
        a=set(a)
        i=1
        count=0
        sum1=0
        while i<k:
            if i not in a and i<=k:
                k=k-i
                count=count+1
            i=i+1
        if k<0:
            return count-1
        else:
            return count
```
