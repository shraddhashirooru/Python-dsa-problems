# Question 1: Spider Steps:

## A spider present at the bottom of the well of height H, needs to get out of it. The walls of the well are very slippery. In each step, it climbs U metres and slips down D metres. If in the last step, the spider gets out of the well by climbing U metres, it does not slip back. Find the number of steps the spider takes.

### Example 1:

Input: 

H = 200, U = 50, D = 1

Output: 5

Explaination: 

First Step: 50 -1 = 49 

Second Step: 49 + 50 - 1 = 98

Third Step: 98 + 50 - 1 = 147 

Fouth Step: 147 + 50 - 1 = 196

Fifth Step: Reach beyond H.

## âœ… Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def minStep(self, H, U, D):
        I=U-D
        H=H-U
        ans=(H)//I
        return ans+2
```
