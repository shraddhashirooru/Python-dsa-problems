# Question 14: Number of meetings can attend:

## You are given timings of n meetings in the form of (start[i], end[i]) where start[i] is the start time of meeting i and end[i] is the finish time of meeting i. Return the maximum number of meetings that can be accommodated in a single meeting room, when only one meeting can be held in the meeting room at a particular time. Note: The start time of one chosen meeting can't be equal to the end time of the other chosen meeting.

### Examples :

Input: start[] = [1, 3, 0, 5, 8, 5], end[] =  [2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 9]

Output: 4

Explanation: Maximum four meetings can be held with given start and end timings. The meetings are - (1, 2), (3, 4), (5,7) and (8,9)

## âœ… Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def maximumMeetings(self,start,end):
        a=list(zip(start,end))
        a.sort(key=lambda x:x[1])
        n=len(a)
        m=[]
        count=0
        m.append(a[0])
        for i in range(1,n):
            if m[-1][1]<a[i][0]:
                count=count+1
                m.append(a[i])
        return count+1
```
