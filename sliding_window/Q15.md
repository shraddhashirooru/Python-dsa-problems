# Question 15: Smallest window containing all characters of another string:

## **Given two strings s1 and s2. Find the smallest window in the string s1 consisting of all the characters(including duplicates) of the string s2. Return "" in case no such window is present. If there are multiple such windows of the same length, return the one with the least starting index. Note: All characters are in lowercase letters.** 

---

### Examples:

Input: s1 = "timetopractice", s2 = "toc"

Output: "toprac"

Explanation: "toprac" is the smallest substring in which "toc" can be found.

Input: s1 = "zoomlazapzo", s2 = "oza"

Output: "apzo"

Explanation: "apzo" is the smallest substring in which "oza" can be found.

## âœ… Python code:

```
from collections import Counter
class Solution:
    #Function to find the smallest window in the string s1 consisting
    #of all the characters of string s2.
    def smallestWindow(self, s1, s2):
        i = 0
        j = 0
        a = Counter(s2)
        b = []
        c=[]
        count=0
        while j < len(s1):
            if s1[j] not in a:
                b.append(s1[j])
            else:
                if a[s1[j]] > 0:
                    count = count + 1
                a[s1[j]] -= 1
                b.append(s1[j])
            while count == len(s2):
                c.append("".join(b))
                b.remove(s1[i])
                if s1[i] in a:
                    a[s1[i]] += 1
                if a[s1[i]]>0:
                    count=count-1
                    i=i+1
                    break
                i = i + 1
            j=j+1
        if c:
            return min(c,key=lambda x:len(x))
        else:
            return []
