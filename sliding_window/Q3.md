# Question 3: Finding number of sub-array having K length meeting the specific threshold:

## **Given an array of integers arr and two integers k and threshold, return the number of sub-arrays of size k and average greater than or equal to threshold.**

---

### Example 1:
Input: arr = [2,2,2,2,5,5,5,8], k = 3, threshold = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: Sub-arrays [2,5,5],[5,5,5] and [5,5,8] have averages 4, 5 and 6 respectively. All other sub-arrays of size 3 have averages less than 4 (the threshold).

## âœ… Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def numOfSubarrays(self, arr: List[int], k: int, threshold: int) -> int:
        i=0
        j=0
        sum1=0
        count=0
        n=len(arr)
        while j<n:
            sum1=sum1+arr[j]
            if j-i+1==k:
                if (sum1)/k>=threshold:
                    count=count+1
                sum1=sum1-arr[i]
                i=i+1
            j=j+1
        return count
```
