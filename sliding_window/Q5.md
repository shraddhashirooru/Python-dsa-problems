# Question 5: Maximum consecutive 1’s by flipping k 0’s:

## **Given a binary array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most k 0's.**

---

### Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.

----

### Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.

## ✅ Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def longestOnes(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        i=0
        j=0
        count=0
        n=len(nums)
        mx=float("-inf")
        while j < n:
            if nums[j]==0:
                count=count+1
                while count>k:
                    if nums[i]==0:
                        count=count-1
                    i=i+1           
            mx=max(mx,j-i+1)
```
            j=j+1
        return mx
