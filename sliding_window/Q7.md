# Question 7: Minimum swap required to make the all elements in array together which are less than K:

## **Given an array arr and a number k. One can apply a swap operation on the array any number of times, i.e choose any two index i and j (i < j) and swap arr[i] , arr[j] . Find the minimum number of swaps required to bring all the numbers less than or equal to k together, i.e. make them a contiguous subarray.**

### Examples :
Input: arr[] = [2, 1, 5, 6, 3], k = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: To bring elements 2, 1, 3 together, swap index 2 with 4 (0-based indexing), i.e. element arr[2] = 5 with arr[4] = 3 such that final array will be- arr[] = [2, 1, 3, 6, 5]

## âœ… Python code:

```
class Solution
    def minSwap (self,arr, k) : 
        i=0
        j=0
        count=0
        while j<len(arr):
            if arr[j]<=k:
                arr[i],arr[j]=arr[j],arr[i]
                if i!=j:
                    count=count+1
                i=i+1
                j=j+1
            else:
                j=j+1
        return count
```
