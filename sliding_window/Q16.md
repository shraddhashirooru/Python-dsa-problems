# Question 16: Count the number of ways to reach the nth stairs:

## **There are n stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. Count the number of ways, the person can reach the top (order does matter).**

### Examples:

class Solution:
    #Function to count number of ways to reach the nth stair.
    def countWays(self,n):
        
        a=0
        b=1
        sum1=0
        sum2=0
        for i in range(n):
            sum1=a+b
            a,b=b,sum1
        return sum1
```
