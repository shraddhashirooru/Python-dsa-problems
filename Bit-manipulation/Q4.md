# Question 4: XORing and clearing:

## You are given an array arr[] of size n. You need to do the following:

1.	You need to calculate the bitwise XOR of each element in the array with its corresponding index (indices start from 0).
2.	After step1, print the array.
3.	Now, set all the elements of arr[] to zero.
4.	Now, print arr[].

### Example 1:

Input:

n = 10

arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}

Output:

1 3 1 7 1 3 1 15 1 3

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Explanation:

First we take xor of every element with

their indices, like (1xor0), (2xor1), (3xor2), (4xor3) and so on.

Now print the resultant array

Now set all the elements of array to zero

Now print the resultant array

## âœ…Python code:

```
class Solution:
    def printArr(self, n, arr):
        for i in arr:
            print(i,end=" ")
        print()
        # printing array elements with spaces
        
    def setToZero(self, n, arr):
        for i in range(n):
            arr[i]=arr[i]^arr[i]
        # setting all elements to zero
        
    def xor1ToN(self, n, arr):
        for i in range(n):
            arr[i]=arr[i]^i
```
