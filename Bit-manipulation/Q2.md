# Question 2: First set bit position:

## Given an integer n. The task is to return the position of the first set bit found from the right side in the binary representation of the number.
Note: If there is no set bit in the integer N, then return 0 from the function.  

### Examples:

Input: n = 18

Output: 2

Explanation: Binary representation of 18 is 010010,the first set bit from the right side is at position 2.

## âœ…Python code:

```
class Solution:  
    #Function to find position of first set bit in the given number.
    def getFirstSetBit(self,n):
        count=0
        while True:
            a=n&1
            count=count+1
            if a==1:
                return count
            n=n>>1
```
