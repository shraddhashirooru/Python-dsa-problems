# Question 3: Set the kth bit and write the number after set:

## Given a number n and a value k. From the right, set the kth bit in the binary representation of n. The position of the Least Significant Bit(or last bit) is 0, the second last bit is 1 and so on. 

### Examples:

Input: n = 10, k = 2

Output: 14

Explanation: Binary representation of the given number 10 is: 1 0 1 0, number of bits in the binary reprsentation is 4. Thus 2nd bit from right is 0. The number after changing this bit to 1 is: 14(1 1 1 0).

## âœ…Python code:

```
class Solution:
	def setKthBit(self, n, k):
	    return n|(1<<k)
```
