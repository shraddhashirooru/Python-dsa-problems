# Question 1: Get, set, clear ith bit:

## Given a 32 bit unsigned integer num and an integer i. Perform following operations on the number - 

1. Get ith bit
2. Set ith bit
3. Clear ith bit
   
Note : For better understanding, we are starting bits from 1 instead 0. (1-based). You have to print space three space separated values ( as shown in output without a line break) and do not have to return anything.

### Examples :

Input: 70 3

Output: 1 70 66

Explanation: Bit at the 3rd position from LSB is 1. (1 0 0 0 1 1 0) .The value of the given number after setting the 3rd bit is 70. The value of the given number after clearing 3rd bit is 66. (1 0 0 0 0 1 0)

## ✅Python code 1:

```
class Solution:
    def bitManipulation(self, num, i):
        
        a=1 if num&(1<<i-1)!=0 else 0
        
        b=num|(1<<i-1)
        
        c= num & ~(1<<i-1)
        
        print(a,b,c)
```

## ✅Python code 2:

```
class Solution:
    def bitManipulation(self, num, i):
        print((num>>(i-1)) & 1, num|(1<<(i-1)), num&(~(1<<(i-1))))
```
